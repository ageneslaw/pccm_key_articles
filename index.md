### ARDS, mechanical ventilation, and lung injury

* Meduri, G. Umberto, et al. **“Effect of Prolonged Methylprednisolone Therapy in Unresolving Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** JAMA, vol. 280, no. 2, July 1998, p. 159, doi:10.1001/jama.280.2.159. 
    * [Meduri Steroids in ARDS 1998.pdf](Meduri Steroids in ARDS 1998.pdf)
    * Small, single center RCT of methylprednisolone in ARDS. Very controversial. Showed improvement in mortality, organ dysfunction scores, and successful extubation. Subsequent studies have failed to replicate this, and shown rebound worsening after steroids were stopped.
<br /><br />

* The ARDS Network. **“Ventilation with Lower Tidal Volumes as Compared with Traditional Tidal Volumes for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 342, no. 18, May 2000, pp. 1301–08, doi:10.1056/NEJM200005043421801. 
    * [ARDSNet Low-TV Ventilation 2000.pdf](ARDSNet Low-TV Ventilation 2000.pdf)
    * Ground-breaking study of low (6mL/kg) versus standard (at the time, 12mL/kg) tidal volume ventilation in ARDS, showing mortality of 31% vs nearly 39% in the two study arms.
<br /><br />

* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network. **“Higher versus Lower Positive End-Expiratory Pressures in Patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 351, no. 4, July 2004, pp. 327–36, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032193. 
    * [ARDSNET High vs Low PEEP 2004.pdf](ARDSNET High vs Low PEEP 2004.pdf)
    * Negative trial. Used low TV ventilation for all patients and plateau pressures below 30cm of H2O. PEEP titrated based on FiO2 level. No difference in mortality based on high PEEP (starting at 12, max 22-24) versus low PEEP (starting at 5, max 18-24) groups.
<br /><br />

* Taylor, Robert W., et al. **“Low-Dose Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Patients.”** Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. 291, no. 13, 2004, pp. 1603–09. 
    * [Taylor iNO for ARDS 2004.pdf](Taylor iNO for ARDS 2004.pdf)
    * Negative trial. Low-dose iNO (5ppm) versus placebo did not impove ventilator-free days. There was a transient increase in oxygenation in the iNO group.
<br /><br />

* Gattinoni, Luciano, and Antonio Pesenti. **“The Concept of ‘Baby Lung.’”** Intensive Care Medicine, vol. 31, no. 6, June 2005, pp. 776–84, doi:10.1007/s00134-005-2627-z. 
    * [Gattinoni The concept of “baby lung” 2005.pdf](Gattinoni The concept of “baby lung” 2005.pdf)
    * Description by Gattinoni (ARDS and ventilation guru) of why low tidal volume ventilation is thought to be beneficial, as well as mechanisms of volutrauma and barotrauma, based on the finding that heterogeneous lung disease in ARDS renders the patient with a functional "baby lung." .
<br /><br />

* Pillow, J. Jane. **“High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation: Mechanisms of Gas Exchange and Lung Mechanics.”** Critical Care Medicine, vol. 33, no. Supplement, Mar. 2005, pp. S135–41, doi:10.1097/01.CCM.0000155789.52984.B7. 
    * [Pillow - 2005 - High-frequency oscillatory ventilation Mechanisms of gas exchange and lung mechanics.pdf](Pillow - 2005 - High-frequency oscillatory ventilation Mechanisms of gas exchange and lung mechanics.pdf)
    * Excellent review on the mechanisms of gas exchange (at least what we understand) in HFOV.
<br /><br />

* Steinberg, Kenneth P., et al. **“Efficacy and Safety of Corticosteroids for Persistent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** The New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 354, no. 16, Apr. 2006, pp. 1671–84, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa051693.
    * [ARDSNET Steroids for ARDS 2006.pdf](..\Key Articles in Critical Care\ARDSNET Steroids for ARDS 2006.pdf)
    * Negative trial. RCT of adults with ARDS for at least 7 days, randomizing to methylprednisolone versus placebo. No difference in 60 day mortality was observed. Methylprednisolone given after 14 days was associated with worsened mortality. Improvements in ventilator-free and shock-free days were observed in the methylprednisolone group, but patients apparently were re-intubated or died later. This is controversial, and the Meduri group has hypothesized that the rapidity of stopping steroids in this trial caused the recrudescence of symptoms. 
<br /><br />

* National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network. **“Comparison of Two Fluid-Management Strategies in Acute Lung Injury.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 354, no. 24, June 2006, pp. 2564–75, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa062200. 
    * [FACTT Fluids in ARDS 2006.pdf](FACTT Fluids in ARDS 2006.pdf)
    * Conservative versus liberal fluid administration strategies in ARDS. Mortality at 60 days was not significantly different between groups. Oxygenation index, lung injury score, and ventilator free days were improved with more conservative fluid strategy.
<br /><br />

* Mercat, Alain, et al. **“Positive End-Expiratory Pressure Setting in Adults With Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** JAMA, vol. 299, no. 6, Feb. 2008, p. 646, doi:10.1001/jama.299.6.646. 
    * [Express Low vs Recruitment PEEP in ARDS 2008.pdf](Express Low vs Recruitment PEEP in ARDS 2008.pdf)
    * PEEP was set empirically in the 5-9 range (minimal distension), or else titrated for a plateau pressure of 28-30 to achieve an open, recruited lung. No difference in mortality was observed, but ventilator-free days and several markers of lung function were improved in the targeted PEEP group..
<br /><br />

* Khemani, Robinder G., et al. **“Effect of Tidal Volume in Children with Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure.”** Intensive Care Medicine, vol. 35, no. 8, 2009, pp. 1428–37, doi:10.1007/s00134-009-1527-z. 
    * [Tidal volume in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.pdf](Tidal volume in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.pdf)
    * Observational study in children with ARDS and ALI according to the definitions at the time, who were ventilated with lung-protective strategies. After adjusting for confounders, tidal volume did not have any association with mortality for children who had tidal volumes in the 6 to 10mL/kg range..
<br /><br />

* Peek, Giles J., et al. **“Efficacy and Economic Assessment of Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR): A Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial.”** The Lancet, vol. 374, no. 9698, Elsevier Ltd, Oct. 2009, pp. 1351–63, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61069-2. 
    * [CESAR ECMO 2009.pdf](CESAR ECMO 2009.pdf)
    * Multicenter RCT of adults with severe ARDS, randomized to conventional mechanical ventilation versus referral to an ECMO center (not necessarily receiving ECMO). Being managed at an ECMO center (not necessarily receiving ECMO) was associated with improvement in the composite outcome of mortality or severe disability.
<br /><br />

* Papazian, Laurent, et al. **“Neuromuscular Blockers in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _The New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 363, no. 12, Sept. 2010, pp. 1107–16, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1005372.
    * [ARDS ACURASYS Neuromuscular blockade 2010.pdf](ARDS ACURASYS Neuromuscular blockade 2010.pdf)
    * RCT of adults with severe ARDS (P/F <150), randomizing to 48 hours of neuromuscular blockade versus placebo. Primary outcomes were death before discharge or within 90 days. After adjusting for confounders, the mortality rate at 90 days was better in the experimental group with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.98). Neither crude 90- nor 28-day mortality were significantly different between groups, although both had trends toward favoring the paralytic group. Criticism has been that this was a small trial (340 patients), and the authors needed to control for multiple variables (which should not be necessary in an RCT) to find a barely-significant result.
<br /><br />

* Ranieri, V. Marco, et al. **“Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: The Berlin Definition.”** JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association, vol. 307, no. 23, 2012, pp. 2526–33, doi:10.1001/jama.2012.5669. 
    * [Berlin ARDS Definition 2012.pdf](Berlin ARDS Definition 2012.pdf)
    * Updated the prior definitions of ARDS and ALI based on P/F ratio. ARDS is now stratified as mild (<300), moderate (200-300), and severe (<100), which associate clearly with mortality. There is no requirement for a low left atrial pressure, but instead only that the pulmonary edema not be fully explained by LA hypertension.
<br /><br />

* Willson, Douglas F., et al. **“Pediatric Calfactant in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial.”** Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, vol. 14, no. 7, 2013, pp. 657–65, doi:10.1097/PCC.0b013e3182917b68. 
    * [Willson Surfactant PARDS 2013.pdf](Willson Surfactant PARDS 2013.pdf)
    * Negative study. Children with lung injury or ARDS were randomized to receive surfactant versus placebo. The trial was stopped due to futility, with no differences observed in mortality, ventilator-free days, or oxygenation.
<br /><br />

* Young, Duncan, et al. **“High-Frequency Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 368, no. 9, Feb. 2013, pp. 806–13, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1215716. 
    * [OSCAR HFOV 2013.pdf](OSCAR HFOV 2013.pdf)
    * Negative study. Adults with ARDS were randomized to conventional ventilation versus HFOV. No differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay were observed. 
<br /><br />

* Guérin, Claude, et al. **“Prone Positioning in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 368, no. 23, June 2013, pp. 2159–68, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1214103. 
    * [PROSEVA Prone Positioning 2013.pdf](PROSEVA Prone Positioning 2013.pdf)
    * Adults with severe ARDS (P/F ratio <150) were randomized to supine position versus prone position for at least 16 hours daily. 28-day mortality was 16% versus 33% in the prone versus supine group, and 90-day mortality was 24% versus 41%. One of the few clearly positive studies of a "therapy" for ARDS.
<br /><br />

* Ferguson, Niall D., et al. **“High-Frequency Oscillation in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 368, no. 9, Feb. 2013, pp. 795–805, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1215554. 
    * [OSCILLATE HFOV 2013.pdf](OSCILLATE HFOV 2013.pdf)
    * Negative study, trial halted early due to concern for harm in the experimental group (arguably a positive study, but in the wrong direction!). Adults with moderate to severe ARDS were randomized to conventional ventilation versus HFOV. Mortality was 47% in the HFOV group versus 35% in the control group, for a relative risk of death of 1.33 (95% CI 1.09-1.64, p=0.005). 
<br /><br />

* de Jager, Pauline, et al. **“Tidal Volume and Mortality in Mechanically Ventilated Children.”** Critical Care Medicine, vol. 42, no. 12, 2014, pp. 2461–72, doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000000546. 
    * [Tidal Volume and Mortality in Critically Ill Children 2014.pdf](Tidal Volume and Mortality in Critically Ill Children 2014.pdf)
    * Meta-analysis of 8 RCTs and observational studies of tidal volumes in children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. No relationship was observed between tidal volume and mortality when stratifying by low (<7mL/kg) versus high (>12mL/kg) tidal volume, stratifying into multiple categories of tidal volume, or only analyzing children with ARDS/ALI.

    * [PALICC Pediatric ARDS Guidelines for Ventilation  2015.pdf](PALICC Pediatric ARDS Guidelines for Ventilation  2015.pdf)
    * Guidelines from PALICC (Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Concensus Conference Group) on strategies and settings for mechanical ventilation in children.

* Amato, Marcelo B. P., et al. **“Driving Pressure and Survival in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 372, no. 8, Feb. 2015, pp. 747–55, doi:10.1056/NEJMsa1410639. 
    * [Amato Driving Pressure in ARDS 2015.pdf](Amato Driving Pressure in ARDS 2015.pdf)
    * Re-analysis of 9 prior studies of ARDS investigating relationship of various ventilatory variables and mortality. The key finding was that driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) is directly associated with mortality when PEEP and/or plateau pressure are held constant. Tidal volume was not associated after controlling for other variables.

    * [PALICC ARDS Definition 2015.pdf](PALICC ARDS Definition 2015.pdf)
    * Management guidelines and definitions for pediatric ARDS from PALICC (Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Concensus Conference Group). Defines oxygenation index (OI) as (MAP x FiO2) / PaO2, and the oxygenation saturation index (OSI) as (MAP x FiO2) / SpO2. These variables take pressure into account, which P/F ratio does not. Patients were stratified as mild (OI 4-8, OSI 4-7.5), moderate (OI 8-16, OSI 7.5-12), and severe (OI>16, OSI >12). Mortality was directly associated with increasing OI and OSI.

* Sud, Sachin, et al. **“High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation versus Conventional Ventilation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, edited by Sachin Sud, vol. 4, no. 4, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Apr. 2016, p. CD004085, doi:10.1002/14651858.CD004085.pub4. 
    * [ARDS HFOV vs conventional ventilation Cochrane 2016.pdf](ARDS HFOV vs conventional ventilation Cochrane 2016.pdf)
    * Cochrane review of 10 RCTs investigating HFOV versus conventional modes of ventilation for ARDS. In contrast to the prior Cochrane review, no pooled effect was seen on mortality. Heterogeneity between trials was notably quite high and quality of the evidence was universally very low.
<br /><br />

* Meduri, G. Umberto, et al. **“Prolonged Glucocorticoid Treatment Is Associated with Improved ARDS Outcomes: Analysis of Individual Patients’ Data from Four Randomized Trials and Trial-Level Meta-Analysis of the Updated Literature.”** Intensive Care Medicine, vol. 42, no. 5, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2016, pp. 829–40, doi:10.1007/s00134-015-4095-4. 
    * [Meduri Steroids ARDS Prolonged Therapy 2016.pdf](Meduri Steroids ARDS Prolonged Therapy 2016.pdf)
    * Studies of methylprednisolone in ARDS were initially very promising, but after many patients in the steroid group were later reintubated or died. The authors perfomed a trial-level meta-analysis of multiple RCTs of steroids for adult ARDS specifically investigating only patients who received prolonged courses of steroids (>7 days). Outcomes were time to unassisted breathing (UAB), ventilator-free and ICU-free days, and 28 day mortality. Prolonged steroids courses were associated with improvement in most outcomes: 12 vs 29 days to UAB; 80% versus 50% achieving UAB; 20% vs 33% mortality

* Gattinoni, Luciano, et al. **“The Future of Mechanical Ventilation: Lessons from the Present and the Past.”** Critical Care, vol. 21, no. 1, Critical Care, 2017, p. 183, doi:10.1186/s13054-017-1750-x. 
    * [Mechanical ventilation future lessons from past and present 2017.pdf](Mechanical ventilation future lessons from past and present 2017.pdf)

* Meade, Maureen O., et al. **“Severity of Hypoxemia and Effect of High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 196, no. 6, Sept. 2017, pp. 727–33, doi:10.1164/rccm.201609-1938OC. 
    * [ARDS HFOV and Severity of Hypoxemia 2017.pdf](ARDS HFOV and Severity of Hypoxemia 2017.pdf)
    * Re-analysis of several HFOV versus conventional ventilation studies. Patients with the most severe hypoxemia based upon P/F ratios may benefit from HFOV, whereas those with less severe hypoxemia may be harmed. The cutoff where the risk/benefit ratio favors HFOV is unclear. The authors cautiously offer a P/F ratio of less than 64 as one cutoff based upon their statistical analysis.
<br /><br />

* Barbaro, Ryan P., et al. **“Does Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Improve Survival in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Failure?”** American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 197, no. 9, 2018, pp. 1177–86, doi:10.1164/rccm.201709-1893OC. 
    * [Barbaro ECMO for PARDS 2018.pdf](Barbaro ECMO for PARDS 2018.pdf)
    * Propensity score- and case-matched study of patients receiving ECMO versus conventional therapy for ARDS. No difference was observed in mortality between groups using either matching strategy.
<br /><br />

* Khemani, Robinder G., et al. **“Positive End-Expiratory Pressure Lower Than the ARDS Network Protocol Is Associated with Higher Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Mortality.”** American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, vol. 198, no. 1, July 2018, pp. 77–89, doi:10.1164/rccm.201707-1404OC. 
    * [ARDS pARDS PEEP Lower than guidelines associated with mortality 2018.pdf](ARDS pARDS PEEP Lower than guidelines associated with mortality 2018.pdf)
    * Retrospective analysis of children with ARDS comparing the level of PEEP that patients received, in comparison to PEEP recommended by ARDSnet guidelines for a given FiO2. One-quarter of children received lower PEEP than recommended, and these children had higher mortality than those receiving PEEP according to recommendations. This remained significant after adjusting for multiple confounders and usin propensity score adjustment.
<br /><br />

* Combes, Alain, et al. **“Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 378, no. 21, 2018, pp. 1965–75, doi:10.1056/nejmoa1800385. 
    * [EOLIA ECMO 2018.pdf](EOLIA ECMO 2018.pdf)
    * RCT of adults with very severe ARDS (P/F ratio less than 80, among other variables) comparing up-front ECMO versus conventional management. ECMO was notably allowed as a rescue strategy and was used in 28% of the control group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (35% in the ECMO group, 46% in the conventional group). However, given the rate of crossover (likely biasing towards the null hypothesis) and the 11% absolute difference in mortality, this arguably provides evidence that ECMO is useful for ARDS, but not necessarily as an up-front strategy.
<br /><br />

* Meduri, G. Umberto, et al. **“An Exploratory Reanalysis of the Randomized Trial on Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** Critical Care Medicine, vol. 46, no. 6, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2018, pp. 884–91, doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000003021. 
    * [Meduri Steroids ARDS re-analysis 2018.pdf](Meduri Steroids ARDS re-analysis 2018.pdf)
    * Another re-analysis by the Meduri group of methylprednisolone for ARDS (see the commentary from the 2016 article). Re-analysis of the primary trial from 2006 (LaSRS) with the hypothesis that steroids were withdrawn too early in that study (discontinued over 48 hours) without tapering, which led to recrudescence of symptoms. This article shows that mortality and ventilator-free days were improved during active therapy in the LaSRS trial, which the authors argue supports using steroids in ARDS, but with a gradual taper.

    * Negative study. Larger, multi-center trial similar to the ACURASYS 2010 study. This was an RCT of 1006 adults with moderate to severe ARDS (P/F<150), randomizing to continuous paralytic and deep sedation for 48 hours, versus usual care. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality at 90 days. Trial was stopped early for futility.
