## <a name='ARDSmechanicalventilationandlunginjury'></a>ARDS, mechanical ventilation, and lung injury

* [1998. Meduri, G. Umberto, et al.](Meduri Steroids in ARDS 1998.pdf) **“Effect of Prolonged Methylprednisolone Therapy in Unresolving Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _JAMA_, vol. 280, no. 2, July 1998, p. 159, doi:10.1001/jama.280.2.159.
  * Small, single center RCT of methylprednisolone in ARDS. Very controversial. Showed improvement in mortality, organ dysfunction scores, and successful extubation. Subsequent studies have failed to replicate this, and shown rebound worsening after steroids were stopped..

* [2000. The ARDS Network.](ARDSNet Low-TV Ventilation 2000.pdf) **“Ventilation with Lower Tidal Volumes as Compared with Traditional Tidal Volumes for Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 342, no. 18, May 2000, pp. 1301–08, doi:10.1056/NEJM200005043421801. 
  * Ground-breaking study of low (6mL/kg) versus standard (at the time, 12mL/kg) tidal volume ventilation in ARDS, showing mortality of 31% vs nearly 39% in the two study arms.

* [2004. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network.](ARDSNET High vs Low PEEP 2004.pdf) **“Higher versus Lower Positive End-Expiratory Pressures in Patients with the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 351, no. 4, July 2004, pp. 327–36, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa032193. 
  * Negative trial. Used low TV ventilation for all patients and plateau pressures below 30cm of H2O. PEEP titrated based on FiO2 level. No difference in mortality based on high PEEP (starting at 12, max 22-24) versus low PEEP (starting at 5, max 18-24) groups.

* [2004. Taylor, Robert W., et al.](Taylor iNO for ARDS 2004.pdf) **“Low-Dose Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Patients.”** _Journal of the American Medical Association_, vol. 291, no. 13, 2004, pp. 1603–09. 
  * Negative trial. Low-dose iNO (5ppm) versus placebo did not impove ventilator-free days. There was a transient increase in oxygenation in the iNO group.

* [2005. Gattinoni, Luciano, and Antonio Pesenti.](Gattinoni The concept of “baby lung” 2005.pdf) **“The Concept of ‘Baby Lung.’”** _Intensive Care Medicine_, vol. 31, no. 6, June 2005, pp. 776–84, doi:10.1007/s00134-005-2627-z. 
  * Description by Gattinoni (ARDS and ventilation guru) of why low tidal volume ventilation is thought to be beneficial, as well as mechanisms of volutrauma and barotrauma, based on the finding that heterogeneous lung disease in ARDS renders the patient with a functional "baby lung." .

* [2005. Pillow, J. Jane.](Pillow - 2005 - High-frequency oscillatory ventilation Mechanisms of gas exchange and lung mechanics.pdf) **“High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation: Mechanisms of Gas Exchange and Lung Mechanics.”** _Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 33, no. Supplement, Mar. 2005, pp. S135–41, doi:10.1097/01.CCM.0000155789.52984.B7. 
  * Excellent review on the mechanisms of gas exchange (at least what we understand) in HFOV.

* [2006. Steinberg, Kenneth P., et al.](ARDSNET Steroids for ARDS 2006.pdf) **“Efficacy and Safety of Corticosteroids for Persistent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 354, no. 16, Apr. 2006, pp. 1671–84, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa051693.
  * Negative trial. RCT of adults with ARDS for at least 7 days, randomizing to methylprednisolone versus placebo. No difference in 60 day mortality was observed. Methylprednisolone given after 14 days was associated with worsened mortality. Improvements in ventilator-free and shock-free days were observed in the methylprednisolone group, but patients apparently were re-intubated or died later. This is controversial, and the Meduri group has hypothesized that the rapidity of stopping steroids in this trial caused the recrudescence of symptoms. 

* [2006. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network.](FACTT Fluids in ARDS 2006.pdf) **“Comparison of Two Fluid-Management Strategies in Acute Lung Injury.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 354, no. 24, June 2006, pp. 2564–75, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa062200. 
  * Conservative versus liberal fluid administration strategies in ARDS. Mortality at 60 days was not significantly different between groups. Oxygenation index, lung injury score, and ventilator free days were improved with more conservative fluid strategy.

* [2008. Mercat, Alain, et al.](Express Low vs Recruitment PEEP in ARDS 2008.pdf) **“Positive End-Expiratory Pressure Setting in Adults With Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _JAMA_, vol. 299, no. 6, Feb. 2008, p. 646, doi:10.1001/jama.299.6.646. 
  * PEEP was set empirically in the 5-9 range (minimal distension), or else titrated for a plateau pressure of 28-30 to achieve an open, recruited lung. No difference in mortality was observed, but ventilator-free days and several markers of lung function were improved in the targeted PEEP group.

* [2009. Khemani, Robinder G., et al.](Tidal volume in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.pdf) **“Effect of Tidal Volume in Children with Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure.”** _Intensive Care Medicine_, vol. 35, no. 8, 2009, pp. 1428–37, doi:10.1007/s00134-009-1527-z. 
  * Observational study in children with ARDS and ALI according to the definitions at the time, who were ventilated with lung-protective strategies. After adjusting for confounders, tidal volume did not have any association with mortality for children who had tidal volumes in the 6 to 10mL/kg range.

* [2009. Peek, Giles J., et al.](CESAR ECMO 2009.pdf)**“Efficacy and Economic Assessment of Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR): A Multicentre Randomised Controlled Trial.”** _The Lancet_, vol. 374, no. 9698, Elsevier Ltd, Oct. 2009, pp. 1351–63, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(09) 61069-2. 
  * Multicenter RCT of adults with severe ARDS, randomized to conventional mechanical ventilation versus referral to an ECMO center (not necessarily receiving ECMO). Being managed at an ECMO center (not necessarily receiving ECMO) was associated with improvement in the composite outcome of mortality or severe disability.

* [2010. Papazian, Laurent, et al.](ARDS ACURASYS Neuromuscular blockade 2010.pdf) **“Neuromuscular Blockers in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _The New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 363, no. 12, Sept. 2010, pp. 1107–16, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1005372.
  * RCT of adults with severe ARDS (P/F <150), randomizing to 48 hours of neuromuscular blockade versus placebo. Primary outcomes were death before discharge or within 90 days. After adjusting for confounders, the mortality rate at 90 days was better in the experimental group with a hazard ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.98). Neither crude 90- nor 28-day mortality were significantly different between groups, although both had trends toward favoring the paralytic group. Criticism has been that this was a small trial (340 patients), and the authors needed to control for multiple variables (which should not be necessary in an RCT) to find a barely-significant result.

* [2012. Ranieri, V. Marco, et al.](Berlin ARDS Definition 2012.pdf) **“Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: The Berlin Definition.”** _JAMA_, vol. 307, no. 23, 2012, pp. 2526–33, doi:10.1001/jama.2012.5669. 
  * Updated the prior definitions of ARDS and ALI based on P/F ratio. ARDS is now stratified as mild (<300), moderate (200-300), and severe (<100), which associate clearly with mortality. There is no requirement for a low left atrial pressure, but instead only that the pulmonary edema not be fully explained by LA hypertension.

* [2013. Willson, Douglas F., et al.](Willson Surfactant PARDS 2013.pdf) **“Pediatric Calfactant in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial.”** _Pediatric Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 14, no. 7, 2013, pp. 657–65, doi:10.1097/PCC.0b013e3182917b68. 
  * Negative trial. Children with lung injury or ARDS were randomized to receive surfactant versus placebo. The trial was stopped due to futility, with no differences observed in mortality, ventilator-free days, or oxygenation.

* [2013. Young, Duncan, et al.](OSCAR HFOV 2013.pdf) **“High-Frequency Oscillation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 368, no. 9, Feb. 2013, pp. 806–13, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1215716. 
  * Negative trial. Adults with ARDS were randomized to conventional ventilation versus HFOV. No differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay were observed. 

* [2013. Guérin, Claude, et al.](PROSEVA Prone Positioning 2013.pdf) **“Prone Positioning in Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 368, no. 23, June 2013, pp. 2159–68, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1214103. 
  * Adults with severe ARDS (P/F ratio <150) were randomized to supine position versus prone position for at least 16 hours daily. 28-day mortality was 16% versus 33% in the prone versus supine group, and 90-day mortality was 24% versus 41%. One of the few clearly positive studies of a "therapy" for ARDS.

* [2013. Ferguson, Niall D., et al.](OSCILLATE HFOV 2013.pdf) **“High-Frequency Oscillation in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 368, no. 9, Feb. 2013, pp. 795–805, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1215554. 
  * Negative trial, trial halted early due to concern for harm in the experimental group (arguably a positive study, but in the wrong direction!). Adults with moderate to severe ARDS were randomized to conventional ventilation versus HFOV. Mortality was 47% in the HFOV group versus 35% in the control group, for a relative risk of death of 1.33 (95% CI 1.09-1.64, p=0.005). 

* [2014. de Jager, Pauline, et al.](Tidal Volume and Mortality in Critically Ill Children 2014.pdf) **“Tidal Volume and Mortality in Mechanically Ventilated Children.”** _Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 42, no. 12, 2014, pp. 2461–72, doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000000546. 
  * Meta-analysis of 8 RCTs and observational studies of tidal volumes in children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. No relationship was observed between tidal volume and mortality when stratifying by low (<7mL/kg) versus high (>12mL/kg) tidal volume, stratifying into multiple categories of tidal volume, or only analyzing children with ARDS/ALI.

* [2015. Rimensberger, Peter C., and Ira M. Cheifetz.](PALICC Pediatric ARDS Guidelines for Ventilation  2015.pdf) **“Ventilatory Support in Children With Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _Pediatric Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 16, 2015, pp. S51–60, doi:10.1097/PCC.0000000000000433. 
  * Guidelines from PALICC (Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Concensus Conference Group) on strategies and settings for mechanical ventilation in children.

* [2015. Amato, Marcelo B. P., et al.](Amato Driving Pressure in ARDS 2015.pdf) **“Driving Pressure and Survival in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 372, no. 8, Feb. 2015, pp. 747–55, doi:10.1056/NEJMsa1410639. 
  * Re-analysis of 9 prior studies of ARDS investigating relationship of various ventilatory variables and mortality. The key finding was that driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) is directly associated with mortality when PEEP and/or plateau pressure are held constant. Tidal volume was not associated after controlling for other variables. 

* [2015. Slutsky, Arthur S.](History of Mechanical Ventilation 2015.pdf) **“History of Mechanical Ventilation. From Vesalius to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury.”** _American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 191, no. 10, May 2015, pp. 1106–15, doi:10.1164/rccm.201503-0421PP. 

* [2015. Jouvet, Philippe, et al.](PALICC ARDS Definition 2015.pdf) **“Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Consensus Recommendations from the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference.”** _Pediatric Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 16, no. 5, 2015, pp. 428–39, doi:10.1097/PCC.0000000000000350. 
  * Management guidelines and definitions for pediatric ARDS from PALICC (Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Concensus Conference Group). Defines oxygenation index (OI) as (MAP x FiO2) / PaO2, and the oxygenation saturation index (OSI) as (MAP x FiO2) / SpO2. These variables take pressure into account, which P/F ratio does not. Patients were stratified as mild (OI 4-8, OSI 4-7.5), moderate (OI 8-16, OSI 7.5-12), and severe (OI>16, OSI >12). Mortality was directly associated with increasing OI and OSI.

* [2016. Sud, Sachin, et al.](ARDS HFOV vs conventional ventilation Cochrane 2016.pdf) **“High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation versus Conventional Ventilation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews_, edited by Sachin Sud, vol. 4, no. 4, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Apr. 2016, p. CD004085, doi:10.1002/14651858.CD004085.pub4. 
  * Cochrane review of 10 RCTs investigating HFOV versus conventional modes of ventilation for ARDS. In contrast to the prior Cochrane review, no pooled effect was seen on mortality. Heterogeneity between trials was notably quite high and quality of the evidence was universally very low.

* [2016. Meduri, G. Umberto, et al.](Meduri Steroids ARDS Prolonged Therapy 2016.pdf) **“Prolonged Glucocorticoid Treatment Is Associated with Improved ARDS Outcomes: Analysis of Individual Patients’ Data from Four Randomized Trials and Trial-Level Meta-Analysis of the Updated Literature.”** _Intensive Care Medicine_, vol. 42, no. 5, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2016, pp. 829–40, doi:10.1007/s00134-015-4095-4. 
  * Studies of methylprednisolone in ARDS were initially very promising, but after many patients in the steroid group were later reintubated or died. The authors perfomed a trial-level meta-analysis of multiple RCTs of steroids for adult ARDS specifically investigating only patients who received prolonged courses of steroids (>7 days). Outcomes were time to unassisted breathing (UAB), ventilator-free and ICU-free days, and 28 day mortality. Prolonged steroids courses were associated with improvement in most outcomes: 12 vs 29 days to UAB; 80% versus 50% achieving UAB; 20% vs 33% mortality

* [2017. Gattinoni, Luciano, et al.](Mechanical ventilation future lessons from past and present 2017.pdf) **“The Future of Mechanical Ventilation: Lessons from the Present and the Past.”** _Critical Care_, vol. 21, no. 1, Critical Care, 2017, p. 183, doi:10.1186/s13054-017-1750-x. 

* [2017. Meade, Maureen O., et al.](ARDS HFOV and Severity of Hypoxemia 2017.pdf) **“Severity of Hypoxemia and Effect of High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 196, no. 6, Sept. 2017, pp. 727–33, doi:10.1164/rccm.201609-1938OC. 
  * Re-analysis of several HFOV versus conventional ventilation studies. Patients with the most severe hypoxemia based upon P/F ratios may benefit from HFOV, whereas those with less severe hypoxemia may be harmed. The cutoff where the risk/benefit ratio favors HFOV is unclear. The authors cautiously offer a P/F ratio of less than 64 as one cutoff based upon their statistical analysis.

* [2018. Barbaro, Ryan P., et al.](Barbaro ECMO for PARDS 2018.pdf) **“Does Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Improve Survival in Pediatric Acute Respiratory Failure?”** _American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 197, no. 9, 2018, pp. 1177–86, doi:10.1164/rccm.201709-1893OC. 
  * Propensity score- and case-matched study of patients receiving ECMO versus conventional therapy for ARDS. No difference was observed in mortality between groups using either matching strategy.

* [2018. Khemani, Robinder G., et al.](ARDS pARDS PEEP Lower than guidelines associated with mortality 2018.pdf) **“Positive End-Expiratory Pressure Lower Than the ARDS Network Protocol Is Associated with Higher Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Mortality.”** _American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 198, no. 1, July 2018, pp. 77–89, doi:10.1164/rccm.201707-1404OC. 
  * Retrospective analysis of children with ARDS comparing the level of PEEP that patients received, in comparison to PEEP recommended by ARDSnet guidelines for a given FiO2. One-quarter of children received lower PEEP than recommended, and these children had higher mortality than those receiving PEEP according to recommendations. This remained significant after adjusting for multiple confounders and usin propensity score adjustment.

* [2018. Combes, Alain, et al.](EOLIA ECMO 2018.pdf) **“Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 378, no. 21, 2018, pp. 1965–75, doi:10.1056/nejmoa1800385. 
  * RCT of adults with very severe ARDS (P/F ratio less than 80, among other variables) comparing up-front ECMO versus conventional management. ECMO was notably allowed as a rescue strategy and was used in 28% of the control group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (35% in the ECMO group, 46% in the conventional group). However, given the rate of crossover (likely biasing towards the null hypothesis) and the 11% absolute difference in mortality, this arguably provides evidence that ECMO is useful for ARDS, but not necessarily as an up-front strategy.

* [2018. Meduri, G. Umberto, et al.](Meduri Steroids ARDS re-analysis 2018.pdf) **“An Exploratory Reanalysis of the Randomized Trial on Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _Critical Care Medicine_, vol. 46, no. 6, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2018, pp. 884–91, doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000003021. 
  * Another re-analysis by the Meduri group of methylprednisolone for ARDS (see the commentary from the 2016 article). Re-analysis of the primary trial from 2006 (LaSRS) with the hypothesis that steroids were withdrawn too early in that study (discontinued over 48 hours) without tapering, which led to recrudescence of symptoms. This article shows that mortality and ventilator-free days were improved during active therapy in the LaSRS trial, which the authors argue supports using steroids in ARDS, but with a gradual taper.

* [2019. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute PETAL Clinical Trials Network.](..\Key Articles in Critical Care\ROSE Paralytic ARDS 2019.pdf) **“Early Neuromuscular Blockade in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 380, no. 21, 2019, pp. 1997–2008, doi:10.1056/nejmoa1901686. 
  * Negative trial. Larger, multi-center trial similar to the ACURASYS 2010 study. This was an RCT of 1006 adults with moderate to severe ARDS (P/F<150), randomizing to continuous paralytic and deep sedation for 48 hours, versus usual care. The primary outcome was inhospital mortality at 90 days. Trial was stopped early for futility.

## <a name='Cardiothoracicsurgery'></a>Cardiothoracic surgery

* [2003. Hoffman, Timothy M., et al.](PRIMACORP Milrinone for low-cardic output syndrome 2003.pdf) **“Efficacy and Safety of Milrinone in Preventing Low Cardiac Output Syndrome in Infants and Children after Corrective Surgery for Congenital Heart Disease.”** _Circulation_, vol. 107, no. 7, 2003, pp. 996–1002, doi:10.1161/01.CIR.0000051365.81920.28.
  * The "PRIMACORP" (PRophylactic Intravenous use of Milrinone After Cardiac OpeRation in Pediatrics) trial. Double-blinded RCT of low- versus high-dose milrinone, compared to placebo. High dose milrinone significantly reduced the risk of low-cardiac output syndrome (29.5% placebo, 11.7% milrinone). The authors reported a relative risk reduction of 55% (and we can find an absolute risk reduction of 17.8%, for a NNT between 5 and 6 to prevent one case of low cardiac output syndrome). However, only 2 (of 242) patients died, and other long-term outcomes were not tracked, so the significance of preventing LCOS is not clear based upon this study.

* [2010. Ohye, Richard G., et al.](SVR Single Ventricle BTS vs Sano 2010.pdf) **“Comparison of Shunt Types in the Norwood Procedure for Single-Ventricle Lesions.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 362, no. 21, May 2010, pp. 1980–92, doi:10.1056/NEJMoa0912461.
  * Single Ventricle Reconstruction ("SVR") trial. Multicenter RCT in which 549 infants undergoing a Norwood were randomized to a BTT versus a Sano shunt. Transplant-free survival was higher with a Sano shunt (74% vs 64%), but involved more interventions and complications. After 1 year, the survival benefit (as measured by hazard ratio) of a Sano shunt became non-significant. Most deaths in fact occurred between the Norwood and Stage II palliation.

  * Safe Pediatric Euglycemia after Cardiac Surgery ("SPECS") trial. Two-center RCT randomizing children undergoing surgery with bypass to tight glycemic control (maintaining 80-110 mg/dL glucose) versus standard care. Continuous glucose monitoring was used as well as fingerstick checks. 989 children were randomized. The primary outcome was rate of health-care associated infecitons, which was no different between tight control and usual care groups (8.9 versus 9.8 per 1000 patient-days). Secondary outcomes, such as mortality and LOS, were also the same. Severe hypoglycemia (less than 40mg/dL) was observed in 3% versus 1% of the tight control versus normal control groups.

* [2001. Glaser, Nicole, et al.](Glaser DKA Fluids 2001.pdf) **“Risk Factors for Cerebral Edema in Children with Diabetic Ketoacidosis.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 344, no. 4, Jan. 2001, pp. 264–69, doi:10.1056/NEJM200101253440404.
  * Multi-center, retrospective study of children with DKA, comparing those who did versus did not develop cerebral edema. Children with DKA-associated cerebral edema were compared to (1) randomly selected controls with DKA, and (2) matched controls with DKA. Cerebral edema occurred in 61 of 6977 (0.9%) of hospitalizations. Multvariable analysis revealed the following associations with developing cerebral edema: elevated BUN, lower PaCO2, faster rate of increase in serum Na, and treatment with bicarbonate. Important to note is that this is a retrospective, case-control study, inferring causality is not possible, and it may be even more challenging than in cohort studies.

* [2018. Kuppermann, Nathan, et al.](PECARN DKA Fluids 2018.pdf) **“Clinical Trial of Fluid Infusion Rates for Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis.”** _New England Journal of Medicine_, vol. 378, no. 24, June 2018, pp. 2275–87, doi:10.1056/nejmoa1716816.
  * PECARN DKA FLUID study. Negative trial. Multi-center RCT of rates of administration and fluid sodium content in pediatric DKA. The outcome was a decline in GCS on two consecutive scores. Only children with a GCS >11 on admission were included (after the 2nd year of the study, due to concerns among participating sites). 4 study arms: high vs. low rehydration rate, and 0.9% vs. 0.45% sodium chloride. No differences were observed in any of the primary (decline in GCS) or secondary (brain injury, memory recall tests) outcomes. 1 patient died of cerebral edema and herniation during the study, who was in the fast rehydration / hypotonic fluid group. Interpretation of this study is hotly debated and very much in the eye of the beholder.

  * RCT of adults with very severe ARDS (P/F ratio less than 80, among other variables) comparing up-front ECMO versus conventional management. ECMO was notably allowed as a rescue strategy and was used in 28% of the control group. No significant difference in mortality was observed (35% in the ECMO group, 46% in the conventional group). However, given the rate of crossover (likely biasing towards the null hypothesis) and the 11% absolute difference in mortality, this arguably provides evidence that ECMO is useful for ARDS, but not necessarily as an up-front strategy.

  * The SAFE Study. Negative trial. Multi-center, double-blinded RCT of adults requiring volume resuscitation for nearly any reason, comparing the use of 4% albumin versus normal saline. All other management was at the discretion of the attending physician. There was no difference in 28-day mortality (21% in both groups), nor in the secondary outcomes of ICU or hospital LOS, days of IMV, duration of renal replacement therapy. More fluid overall was administered to the saline group. There was a non-significant improvement in mortality among patients with severe sepsis who received albumin (31% vs 35% mortality).

  * "ALBIOS" study. Negative trial. Open-label RCT in adults with severe sepsis, randomized to receive daily 20% albumin infusions targeting a level of 3.0mg/dL, versus crystalloid alone. Patients in the albumin group had slight improvements in heart rate, blood pressure, and received less total fluid. 28-day mortality was the same in both groups (32%), and 90-day mortality was not significantly different (41% versus 44% in albumin vs. crystalloid groups). No difference was observed in duration of IMV or proportion requiring renal replacement therapy. There was a small improvement (1 day fewer) in time until stopping vasopressor/inotropic medications. A subgroup analysis, unadjusted for multiple comparisons, found a slight survival advantage for patients with septic shock (43.6% vs. 49.9% , ARR 6.3%, RR 0.87 [0.77-0.99]).

  * "SMART" trial. 15,802 adults admitted to an ICU were randomized to normal saline versus balanced crystalloid (LR or Plasma-lyte) for all fluid needs in the ER, ICU, and OR. Primary outcome was a "major kidney event" within 30 days, defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (creatinine >=200% of baseline). More patients in the normal saline group had a major kidney adverse event (14.3% versus 15.4%, OR 0.82-0.99, p=0.04). Patients with sepsis, and those who received high volumes of fluid benefit more from balanced fluids (sepsis mortality 25% versus 29% with balanced fluids).

  * PECARN DKA FLUID study. Negative trial. Multi-center RCT of rates of administration and fluid sodium content in pediatric DKA. The outcome was a decline in GCS on two consecutive scores. Only children with a GCS >11 on admission were included (after the 2nd year of the study, due to concerns among participating sites). 4 study arms: high vs. low rehydration rate, and 0.9% vs. 0.45% sodium chloride. No differences were observed in any of the primary (decline in GCS) or secondary (brain injury, memory recall tests) outcomes. 1 patient died of cerebral edema and herniation during the study, who was in the fast rehydration / hypotonic fluid group. Interpretation of this study is hotly debated and very much in the eye of the beholder.

  * Meta-analysis of 8 RCTs and observational studies of tidal volumes in children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. No relationship was observed between tidal volume and mortality when stratifying by low (<7mL/kg) versus high (>12mL/kg) tidal volume, stratifying into multiple categories of tidal volume, or only analyzing children with ARDS/ALI.

  * "ALBIOS" study. Negative trial. Open-label RCT in adults with severe sepsis, randomized to receive daily 20% albumin infusions targeting a level of 3.0mg/dL, versus crystalloid alone. Patients in the albumin group had slight improvements in heart rate, blood pressure, and received less total fluid. 28-day mortality was the same in both groups (32%), and 90-day mortality was not significantly different (41% versus 44% in albumin vs. crystalloid groups). No difference was observed in duration of IMV or proportion requiring renal replacement therapy. There was a small improvement (1 day fewer) in time until stopping vasopressor/inotropic medications. A subgroup analysis, unadjusted for multiple comparisons, found a slight survival advantage for patients with septic shock (43.6% vs. 49.9% , ARR 6.3%, RR 0.87 [0.77-0.99]).

  * Negative trial. Larger, multi-center trial similar to the ACURASYS 2010 study. This was an RCT of 1006 adults with moderate to severe ARDS (P/F<150), randomizing to continuous paralytic and deep sedation for 48 hours, versus usual care.

  * "BaSICS" trial. Negative trial. 11,052 adult ICU patients who needed at least one dose of volume expansion were randomized to balanced solution versus normal saline, at slower versus faster infusion rates (333mL/hr versus 999mL/hr). All patients had at least one risk factor for an acute kidney injury (age>65, hypotension, vasopressor use, sepsis, IMV, NIPPV, HFNC x12 hours, oliguria, elevated creatinine, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure). The primary outcome was 90 day survival. There was no difference in survival between the balanced fluid versus normal saline group (26.4% versus 27.2%. p=0.47). Virtually none of the 22 secondary and tertiary outcomes were significantly different; none were different in any clinically relevant way.

  * The "PROWESS" study. Randomized, double-blinded RCT of activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa, aka Xigris) versus placebo. Patients were adults only with systemic inflammation and at least one dysfunctional organ system. 1690 patients were randomized and the trial was stopped early, with 28-day mortality 25% vs 30% in the experimental versus control group. Absolute risk reduction was 6.1%, meaning one would need to treat 16-17 patients to prevent death. Criticisms were that only severely ill adults may have benefited, there were many irregularities in the way the trial was conducted and halted, and subsequent smaller placebo-controlled trials failed to corroborate these results. The [RESOLVE study in children (2007)](RESOLVE Activated Protein C 2007.pdf) and [PROWESS-SHOCK study in adults (2012)](PROWESS-SHOCK Activated Protein C 2012.pdf) both eventually showed no effect in either group, and drotrecogin alfa was taken off the market. For a good review on this story, see [2013 Lai & Thompson: "Why activated Protein C was not successful in severe sepsis and septic shock: Are we still tilting at windmills?"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3829688/)

  * "The Rivers Trial," which was the seminal trial kicking off early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). Single center study in which patients with septic shock were randomized to receive 6 hours of protocolized goal-directed therapy, or else standard of care. Goal-directed therapy consisted of standard CVP, MAP, and urine output goals, as well as continuous ScvO2 monitoring to maintain a central venous saturation >70%, a hematocrit >30%, and monitoring of the CI and VO2. Use of resuscitative fluid, inotropic agents, and transfusion thresholds were protocolized in the EGDT group. Patients in the EGDT group had lower mortality (30.5% vs 46.5%), as well as improvement in most markers of illness severity (lactate, APACHE-II scores, base deficit, etc).

  * The SAFE Study. Negative trial. Multi-center, double-blinded RCT of adults requiring volume resuscitation for nearly any reason, comparing the use of 4% albumin versus normal saline. All other management was at the discretion of the attending physician. There was no difference in 28-day mortality (21% in both groups), nor in the secondary outcomes of ICU or hospital LOS, days of IMV, duration of renal replacement therapy. More fluid overall was administered to the saline group. There was a non-significant improvement in mortality among patients with severe sepsis who received albumin (31% vs 35% mortality).
